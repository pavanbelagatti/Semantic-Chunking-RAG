# Semantic Chunking for RAG
LLMs are bound to hallucinate and then we have different strategies to mitigate this hallucination behaviour of LLMs. One such strategy is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where a knowledge base is already augmented/provided to the LLM to retrieve the information from and this way LLMs won't hallucinate since the knowledge base is already specified.
RAG involves a step by step process of loading the documents/data, splitting the documents into chunks using any AI framework such as LangChain or LlamaIndex, and vector embeddings generation for the data and storing these embeddings in a vector database.

So, broadly we can devide the RAG into two main parts, Storing and Retrieval. 

While enahncing our RAG pipeline, one thing we need to looak at is the retriavl strategy and technoques involved. We can improve retrieval in RAG using the proper chunking strategy. But finding the right chunk size for any given text is a very hard question in general.

Today, we will see how semantic chunking works. Semantic Chunking considers the relationships within the text. It divides the text into meaningful, semantically complete chunks. This approach ensures the informationâ€™s integrity during retrieval, leading to a more accurate and contextually appropriate outcome.

Let's experiment with Semantic chunking & see the results
